# SentimentAnalysis

This repo contains code to perform sentiment analysis on text documents. This was created as part of an ongoing research project at Carnegie Mellon Human-Computer Interaction Institute under Dr. Nik Martelaro - for more information about the study, visit <b>link</b>. The project is aimed at assisting user researchers in analyzing large amounts of qualitative data that humans are typically tasked with. Specifically, my role was concerned with developing and using off-the-shelf machine learning tools to perform computational analysis on data such as human speech and movements.
